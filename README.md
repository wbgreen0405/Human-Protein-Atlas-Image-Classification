# Human Protein Atlas Image Classification


![](header.png)

#### Task
Developing of models that capable classify mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. 
The Human Protein Atlas will use these models to build a tool integrated with their smart-microscopy system to identify a protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image.
